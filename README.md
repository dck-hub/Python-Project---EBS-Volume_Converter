<h1 align="center">Python DevOps Project- EBS Volume Check</h1>

<p> <ol>
<li>As a DevOps practitioner, i need to take care of the AWS environment and Make sure it's in compliance with the organization policies. I use AWS EventBridge Rules in combination with AWS Lambda to govern the resources according to the specific policies. </li>
<li>.In this repository, i trigger a Lambda function when a EBS volume is created. I set up EventBridge Rule to capture that particular Event and allow us to monitor and respond to EBS volumes that are type GP2 and convert them to type GP3. </li>

</ol>
